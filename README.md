# bmlt-docker

This is not intended to be run in production (however possible).  You most likely do not want to dockerize MySQL or MariaDB.

This makes it possible to quickly experiment with a BMLT root server without having to set up a server.

### Getting started

Build the docker image:
```shell
make build
``` 

Run the docker image:
```shell
make run
```
